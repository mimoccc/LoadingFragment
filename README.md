LoadingFragment
===============

Implementing the LoadingFragment is just like a regular fragment. Management of the 
progress bar is done completely behind the scenes as your View is programatically injected 
into the structured view hierarchy.

LoadingFragment has three abstract methods:

<pre><code>public abstract View onCreateMainView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState);
public abstract void configureAnimator(ViewAnimator   viewAnimator);
public abstract void configureProgressBackground(ImageView mProgressBBackground);</pre></code>
    
onCreateMainView is identical to onCreateView of a standard fragment. The other two methods provide access to the indeterminate progress bar background, 
and the managing ViewAnimator.

There are two public methods:

<pre><code>showContent()
showLoading()</pre></code>

The starting screen is the progress bar, after your content is done loading simply 
call showContent(). If you need to reload your view's data, call showLoading() first if 
desired.
