LoadingFragment
===============

Implementing the LoadingFragment is just like a regular fragment. Management of the 
progress bar is done completely behind the scenes as your View is programatically injected 
into the structured view hierarchy.

LoadingFragment has three abstract methods:

<pre><code>public abstract View onCreateMainView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState);
public abstract int setInAnimation ();
public abstract int setOutAnimation();</pre></code>
    
onCreateMainView is identicaly to onCreateView of a standard fragment. setIn and setOutAnimation 
return an int of the anim resource to use respectively for the in and out transition.

There are two public methods:

<pre><code>showContent()
showLoading()</pre></code>

The starting screen is the progress bar, after your content is done loading simply 
call showContent(). If you need to reload your view's data, call showLoading() first if 
desired.
